        <h3>Wow</h3>
            <p>A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman -<br>
            and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.</p>

            he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position.</p>
