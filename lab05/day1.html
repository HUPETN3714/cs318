        <h3>The City</h3>
           <p> One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.<br>
             He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.<br> 
             The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.</p>

        <h3>It Was Nice</h3>
            <p> His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought.<br> 
             It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.</p>
