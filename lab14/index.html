        Stuff About Cats
    </header>
    <p>
        The domestic cat is believed to have evolved from the Near Eastern wildcat, whose range covers vast portions of the Middle
        East westward to the Atlantic coast of Africa. Between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago the animal gave rise to the genetic
        lineage that eventually produced all domesticated cats, having diverged from the Near Eastern wildcat around 8,000
        BC in the Middle East. The felids are a rapidly evolving family of mammals that share a common ancestor only 10–15
        million years ago and include lions, tigers, cougars and many others. Within this family, domestic cats (Felis catus)
        are part of the genus Felis, which is a group of small cats containing about seven species (depending upon classification
        scheme). Members of the genus are found worldwide and include the jungle cat (Felis chaus) of southeast Asia, European
        wildcat (F. silvestris silvestris), African wildcat (F. s. lybica), the Chinese mountain cat (F. bieti), and the
        Arabian sand cat (F. margarita), among others. </p>
    <p>The domestic cat was first classified as Felis catus by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae published
        in 1758. Because of modern phylogenetics, domestic cats are usually regarded as another subspecies of the wildcat,
        F. silvestris. This has resulted in mixed usage of the terms, as the domestic cat can be called by its subspecies
        name, Felis silvestris catus. Wildcats have also been referred to as various subspecies of F. catus, but in 2003,
        the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature fixed the name for wildcats as F. silvestris. The most common
        name in use for the domestic cat remains F. catus. Sometimes, the domestic cat has been called Felis domesticus as
        proposed by German naturalist J.C.P. Erxleben in 1777, but these are not valid taxonomic names and have been used
        only rarely in scientific literature. A population of Transcaucasian black feral cats was once classified as Felis
        daemon (Satunin 1904) but now this population is considered to be a part of domestic cat. All the cats in this genus
        share a common ancestor that is believed to have lived around 6–7 million years ago in the Near East (the Middle
        East). The exact relationships within the Felidae are close but still uncertain, e.g. the Chinese mountain cat is
        sometimes classified (under the name Felis silvestris bieti) as a subspecies of the wildcat, like the North African
        variety F. s. lybica.</p>
    <p>Ancient Egyptian sculpture of the cat goddess Bastet. The earliest evidence of felines as Egyptian deities comes from
        c. 3100 BC. In comparison to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process, as the
        form and behavior of the domestic cat is not radically different from those of wildcats and domestic cats are perfectly
        capable of surviving in the wild. Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F. catus populations,
        producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat. This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can
        occur with many other felids, notably the Asian leopard cat. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats
        may have predisposed them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious
        body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Several small felid species may have an inborn tendency
        towards tameness. Cats have either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with humans. Two main theories are given
        about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats in a process of artificial selection as
        they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort
        may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species
        such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply
        tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to
        hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.

    <h1>Paw-some Cat Facts!</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Unlike dogs, cats do not have a sweet tooth. Scientists believe this is due to a mutation in a key taste receptor.</li>
        <li>When a cat chases its prey, it keeps its head level. Dogs and humans bob their heads up and down.</li>
        <li>The technical term for a cat’s hairball is a “bezoar.”</li>
        <li>A group of cats is called a “clowder.”</li>
        <li>A cat can’t climb head first down a tree because every claw on a cat’s paw points the same way. To get down from
            a tree, a cat must back down.</li>
        <li>Cats make about 100 different sounds. Dogs make only about 10.</li>
        <li>Cats are North America’s most popular pets: there are 73 million cats compared to 63 million dogs. Over 30% of households
            in North America own a cat.</li>
        <li>There are more than 500 million domestic cats in the world, with approximately 40 recognized breeds.</li>
        <li>According to Hebrew legend, Noah prayed to God for help protecting all the food he stored on the ark from being eaten
            by rats. In reply, God made the lion sneeze, and out popped a cat.</li>
        <li>While it is commonly thought that the ancient Egyptians were the first to domesticate cats, the oldest known pet
            cat was recently found in a 9,500-year-old grave on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. This grave predates early
            Egyptian art depicting cats by 4,000 years or more.</li>
        <li>During the time of the Spanish Inquisition, Pope Innocent VIII condemned cats as evil and thousands of cats were
            burned. Unfortunately, the widespread killing of cats led to an explosion of the rat population, which exacerbated
            the effects of the Black Death.</li>
        <li>The first cat in space was a French cat named Felicette (a.k.a. “Astrocat”) In 1963, France blasted the cat into
            outer space. Electrodes implanted in her brains sent neurological signals back to Earth. She survived the trip.</li>
        <li>The group of words associated with cat (catt, cath, chat, katze) stem from the Latin catus, meaning domestic cat,
            as opposed to feles, or wild cat.</li>
        <li>A cat’s hearing is better than a dog’s. And a cat can hear high-frequency sounds up to two octaves higher than a
            human.
        </li>
        <li>A cat can travel at a top speed of approximately 31 mph (49 km) over a short distance.</li>
        <li>A cat rubs against people not only to be affectionate but also to mark out its territory with scent glands around
            its face. The tail area and paws also carry the cat’s scent.</li>
        <li>Researchers are unsure exactly how a cat purrs. Most veterinarians believe that a cat purrs by vibrating vocal folds
            deep in the throat. To do this, a muscle in the larynx opens and closes the air passage about 25 times per second.</li>
        <li>Most cats give birth to a litter of between one and nine kittens. The largest known litter ever produced was 19 kittens,
            of which 15 survived.</li>
        <li>Smuggling a cat out of ancient Egypt was punishable by death. Phoenician traders eventually succeeded in smuggling
            felines, which they sold to rich people in Athens and other important cities.</li>
        <li>Many Egyptians worshipped the goddess Bast, who had a woman’s body and a cat’s head.</li>
