            <li>DOCTYPE signals what version of the language HTML you are working in.</li>
<li>Without DOCTYPE the browser will attempt to read the html as an older version. In doing so it enters Quirks mode.</li>
<li>If two HTML elements are placed on the same hierarchical level, they will fall under the same parent element.</li> 
<li>Currently in our browser tab there is the IP address, the folder name, and the web page file name.</li>
<li>The browser places the new body element into the paragraph before the first body element.</li> 
<li>To emphasize the headers to the viewer the browser makes the headers bold and makes the text larger. As the headers go down in importance, the size decreases.</li>
<li>The browser indents the paragraph but the text remains the same.</li>
<li>Contact Lists, Classlists</li>
